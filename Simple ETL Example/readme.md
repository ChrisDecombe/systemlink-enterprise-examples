## Simple ETL Example

This example demonstrates the basics of how to use the SystemLink APIs to perform data extraction and normalization on a file stored on SystemLink Enterprise.

Using the patterns displayed in 'Simple ETL Example.ipynb', you can set up your first Routine in SystemLink Enterprise to automate a data ingestion pipeline that stores data in the SystemLink Dataframe Service.

The 'GenerateTestDataFile.ipynb' is simply used to generate the sample data to use as an input to the main example, and data.csv is available if you'd like to just directly upload a file for testing.
